## Strategic Role
This skill establishes the foundational decision-making framework for the entire website.
All downstream skills MUST align with outputs from this strategy.

## Core Questions This Skill Must Answer
1. Why does this website exist?
2. Who is it for?
3. What action should the user take?
4. What differentiates this site from competitors?

## Mandatory Analysis Steps

### 1. Goal Definition
Classify the website goal into one:
- Conversion-driven (sales, leads, signups)
- Authority-driven (brand, portfolio, credibility)
- Content-driven (education, blog, media)
- Utility-driven (tool, dashboard, SaaS)

Each page must map to **ONE primary goal** only.

### 2. Audience Profiling
Define:
- User intent (informational / transactional / navigational)
- Technical literacy
- Emotional state (trust-seeking, comparison, urgency)

Avoid designing for "everyone".

### 3. Information Architecture
- Define page hierarchy (Primary → Secondary → Supporting)
- Limit top-level navigation to max 6 items
- Enforce shallow navigation (≤ 3 depth)

### 4. Content Strategy
- Define content tone (formal, neutral, conversational)
- Decide content density (minimal vs explanatory)
- Establish CTA frequency rules
